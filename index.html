        A dessert is a type of food that is eaten after lunch or dinner, and
        sometimes after a light meal or snack. It is usually a sweet food, like
        ice cream, cookies, and cakes. In some countries, cheeses such as Brie
        cheese and fruit are served as dessert. Some desserts are made from
        natural resources like fruit juice used in sherbet. Others are simple,
        like pudding and birthday cake. Many desserts are baked (cooked in an
        oven). Some desserts are served with whipped cream as a topping. The
        term dessert can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes,
        cookies, custards, gelatin's, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings,
        sweet soups, and tarts. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses
        because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten
        foods that are more commonly savoury to create desserts.
