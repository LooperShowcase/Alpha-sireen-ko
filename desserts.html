        Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients
        and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of
        bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be
        simple or elaborate and which share features with desserts such as
        pastries, meringues, custards, and pies. The most common ingredients
        include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a
        liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder.
        Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit,
        nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions
        for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit
        preserves, nuts, or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit,
        whipped cream, or syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other icings, and
        decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

      Make the frosting: Combine the sugar, egg whites, and salt in the bowl of
      a stand mixer. Set bowl over a saucepan filled with 1-inch of gently
      simmering water. Whisking gently and constantly, heat mixture until sugar
      is dissolved and mixture is slightly thickened and foamy and registers
      150°F on a candy thermometer or a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes.
      Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment (not the paddle attachment) and beat
      the egg white mixture on medium speed until slightly cooled and thickened,
      about 2 minutes. Add the butter, 1 piece at a time, until smooth and
      creamy. If the mixture looks curdled, that’s okay. Just keep beating until
      it becomes smooth. If the butter becomes too warm and greasy, refrigerate
      the bowl for 10 to 15 minutes then continue to beat until smooth. Add
      chocolate and vanilla and mix until combined. Increase speed to
      medium-high and beat until light, fluffy, and well combined, about 30
      seconds, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Assemble: Place
      one cake layer on a cake turntable or cake stand. Spread an even layer of
      frosting all of the cake layer, pushing it out over the edge just
      slightly. Place the other cake layer upside-down on top of the frosting so
      that the top of the cake is nice and flat. With an offset spatula, spread
      the remaining frosting evenly all over the cake, smoothing the edges.
      Serve or cover and store in the fridge for up to 2 days. Let come to room
      temperature for an hour before serving.
